# Example Posts

These are example files for talks, workshops, etc. that we can use for testing out layout or stylistic changes before we have real talk data. Their real-life analogs will live in the \_posts directory. By default, Jekyll will not publish them and will ignore this folder. To treat them as real posts, use the `--drafts` flag as in `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts`.
