  bio: Based in San Francisco, Kyle Reiley works remotely for the University of Texas
    at Austin Libraries and outside of work spends a lot of his time playing volleyball.
    He is a lead software developer and analyst and works across the stack, untangling
    complex legacy systems, and turning them into modular, maintainable platforms.
    He believes systems should be easy to expand and improve, and that software design
    should focus foremost on the user experience of the product.

  image_alt: A close-up selfie of Kyle Reiley outdoors on a boat, with the Golden
    Gate Bridge visible behind him. He has short brown hair that is slightly wind-tousled,
    thick dark eyebrows, and a prominent brown mustache. His expression is relaxed
    and faintly smiling, with a calm, content look. He is wearing a dusty pink short-sleeve
    T-shirt and a gold chain necklace that rests against his collarbone. Behind him,
    the water is choppy and deep blue-green, with white foam trailing behind the moving
    boat. In the distance, the red-orange towers and suspension cables of the Golden
    Gate Bridge stretch across the frame, partially framed by rolling brown and green
    hills. The sky is bright blue with scattered wispy white clouds, suggesting a
    clear, breezy day. The overall scene conveys motion from the boat, cool coastal
    air, and a scenic view of San Francisco Bay.
