  image_alt: "A close-up selfie of Kyle Reiley outdoors on a boat, with the Golden Gate Bridge visible behind him. He has short brown hair that is slightly wind-tousled, thick dark eyebrows, and a prominent brown mustache. His expression is relaxed and faintly smiling, with a calm, content look. He is wearing a dusty pink short-sleeve T-shirt and a gold chain necklace that rests against his collarbone. Behind him, the water is choppy and deep blue-green, with white foam trailing behind the moving boat. In the distance, the red-orange towers and suspension cables of the Golden Gate Bridge stretch across the frame, partially framed by rolling brown and green hills. The sky is bright blue with scattered wispy white clouds, suggesting a clear, breezy day. The overall scene conveys motion from the boat, cool coastal air, and a scenic view of San Francisco Bay."
