  bio: "The Evergreen Project was initiated by the Georgia Public Library System in 2006 to serve their need for a scalable catalog shared by (as of now) more than 275 public libraries in the state of Georgia. After Evergreen was released, it has since been adopted by a number of library consortia in the US and Canada as well as various individual libraries, and has started being adopted by libraries outside of North America. The Evergreen development community is still growing, with about eleven active committers and roughly 65 individuals who have contributed patches (as of March 3, 2013). However, the Evergreen community is also marked by a high degree of participation by the librarians who use the software and contribute documentation, bug reports, and organizational energy. As such, Evergreen is very much about both the developers *and* the users."

    public libraries to study how a computational justice program model can support
    girls of color (ages 13-16) develop agentic computing identities. This research
    involves the design of computing education programs that support girls of color
    in situating their computing identities within broader self-concepts and in ways
    that highlight how the intersections of race and gender can function as sources
    of power, rather than simply sites of marginalization. Her other related work
    examines how harmful data practices perpetuate structural inequities along racialized
    and gendered lines, and she collaborates with data practitioners to imagine and
    enact more equitable data futures. Her work spans the fields of computing education,
    learning sciences, youth studies, and critical data studies.
