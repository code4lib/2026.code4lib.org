title: "Cybersecurity Preparedness for Libraries: A 2026 Action Plan"
---
Libraries are facing increasingly sophisticated cyber threats that put our data, digital collections, and public trust at risk. Cybersecurity Preparedness for Libraries: A 2026 Action Plan focuses on practical, achievable steps libraries of all sizes can take to strengthen their information security posture. This session will highlight some examples, common vulnerabilities, and emerging risks that could impact library systems and services. We'll discuss some cheap ways to improve security awareness, build incident response capacity, and collaborate more effectively with IT and vendor partners. Participants will leave with some actionable ideas, resources, and strategies they can use to help develop a realistic cybersecurity plan for their library. The goal is to promote a shared culture of security and ensure that libraries remain safe, resilient, and trusted digital stewards in 2026 and beyond.
