What happens when you try to migrate a homegrown system with 20 years of technical debt, with hundreds of contributors, and millions of monthly visits,  in under seven months? Find out in the spine-tingling “Tales from the Online Archive of California Replatforming". 

You'll gasp at the foreshadowing of “It shouldn’t be too hard”. You'll work up a sweat as we recount “Sprinting to the MVP”. You’ll be terrified by the “Attack of the Bots” and “EAD let’s you do WHAT?!?” But fear is only temporary; hope springs anew in “The Developer Strikes Back” and “Managing Great Expectations”. 

Don’t just take our word for it, critics are also saying: “The way they used Airflow to coordinate jobs is interesting.” and “Arclight…at that scale…inconceivable!”
