title: "Photogrammetry with RealityCapture: A Practical Introduction"
---
 In this comprehensive workshop, participants will delve into the world of photogrammetry using RealityCapture, a leading software in the field. This hands-on session is designed to guide attendees through the entire process of creating high-quality 3D models from photographs. You'll also better understand the history of photogrammetry and the mathematics that make it work. Starting with the fundamentals of photogrammetry, we will explore the capabilities of RealityCapture, including image acquisition with fiduciary markers, input processing, and mesh optimization techniques. By the end of the workshop, participants will have the skills to produce detailed and accurate 3D models for various applications such as gaming, virtual reality, 3D printing, and cultural heritage preservation. Whether you're a beginner or looking to enhance your existing skills, this workshop offers valuable insights and practical experience.
