What does it mean to host digitized library collections that state actors would like to destroy? Or to have custody of data and documents that are evidence in a political battle? What responsibilities do we have to Justice, when we might hold evidence relevant to land back lawsuits, which powerful interests would like to destroy? This talk will discuss how to apply agile and DevOps principles to the question of information security for digital libraries, and provide some examples about why it matters.
