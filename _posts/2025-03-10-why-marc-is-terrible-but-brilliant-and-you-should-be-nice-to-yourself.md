title: "Why MARC is terrible but brilliant and you should be nice to yourself"
---
MARC must die, right? Certainly if you’ve ever tried to computationally process it, you’ve been frustrated by the not-quite-structured data, the ways it just doesn’t play nice with the expectations of modern applications. I’m ready to grab my best pitchfork and line up with you, and yet – if you look at it in its historical context, MARC is amazing. Henriette Avram’s papers, as she grappled in public with this new format, are a problem-solving tour de force…she just wasn’t solving the same problems we’re solving today. We’ll walk through this collision of needs, illuminating why MARC is brilliant from a computational standpoint, even if it’s terrible from our computational standpoint. Hopefully along the way you’ll feel better about your own legacy code.
