title: "Technical Introduction to Blue Core"
---
The Blue Core project (currently in Prototype phase) is a shared BIBFRAME RDF environment allowing users across institutions to share and extend BIBFRAME Works and Instances in a collaborative manner. The Blue Core Prototype is a Docker-based environment and can be run locally on a developer's laptop. This session would cover the following:

- Getting the Blue Core stack up and running locally.

- Creating a custom user/group in the Keycloak Bluecore realm

- Ingesting a number of CBD files (with the participants find CBDs in id.loc.gov), either through the command-line, the Graph Toolbox, or a Jupyter Notebook

- Loading and Editing a BF Work/Instance in Sinopia

- Loading and Editing a CBD file in Marva

- Loading resources and then making SPARQL queries in the Graph Toolbox

- Using Blue Core AI Agent(s) in a Jupyter notebook
