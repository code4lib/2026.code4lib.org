title: "New (and Old-Fangled) HTML Elements: What is Accessible Really?"
---
Over the years, the HTML standard has dropped and added many elements for developers to play with. Some, such as &lt;blink&gt; and &lt;marquee&gt;, are long and thankfully gone. Accessibility oten emphasizes using native elements over rolling your own. However, when it comes to accessibility conformance, not every element is equal out of the box. Different elements can interact with each other elements in confounding ways. Assistive technologies may or may not announce elements effectively. This talk will go over various elements and discuss the art of using them accessibly. Elements discussed will include relatively newer ones such as &lt;dialog&gt; and &lt;output&gt; but also longstanding elements such as the definition list posse (&lt;dl&gt;, &lt;dd&gt;, and &lt;dt&gt;).
