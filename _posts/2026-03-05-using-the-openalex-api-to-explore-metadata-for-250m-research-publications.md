title: "Using the OpenAlex API to Explore Metadata for 250M+ Research Publications"
---
As many libraries look for open alternatives to subscription-based databases, OpenAlex has As many libraries look for open alternatives to subscription-based databases, OpenAlex has emerged as a major resource. It offers a comprehensive web interface for searching, but unlike many proprietary tools, it also provides fully open access to its underlying data. This dataset contains metadata for hundreds of millions of works, authors, and institutions.

Finally, we will look at how this data is used in the real world. Using Keenious as an example, we will show how we take raw OpenAlex data and use it in a working research tool. We will walkthrough the process of turning raw data into a finished product and discuss the practical challenges of handling such a large dataset
