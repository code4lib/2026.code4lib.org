title: "Ensuring Institutional Repository Accessibility: Integrating Automated Accessibility Checks and Remediation Workflows"
---
We will outline an enhanced Institutional Repository deposit workflow that includes new accessibility testing protocols, feedback mechanisms, and seamless integration into the existing institutional repository deposit process. This workflow includes integrated accessibility testing tools, allowing researchers to receive feedback on their submissions in real time.  

By April 2026, all deposits to institutional repositories must comply with the latest accessibility policies to ensure they are usable by all, including individuals with diverse abilities. Although responsibility for compliance lies with the depositor, the institutional repository’s Curation team is essential in educating and supporting authors in this process. 

Our objective is to integrate new steps within the current deposit process to educate and engage depositors in making their work accessible. These steps will assess each submission’s level of accessibility compliance and inform depositors of the results. Based on these results, depositors will be empowered to either seek Curation team assistance or proceed with the necessary corrections themselves. By providing the necessary tools and guidance, we aim to help authors identify and address any accessibility gaps. The process ensures compliance without burdening or discouraging researchers from depositing their work, remaining as simple and minimally disruptive as possible.
