title: ChatGPT as Shortcut for Integrating Digital Humanities into the History Classroom
---
Abstract: Based on ChatGPT-themed pedagogical experiments in a history course at the University at Buffalo, this presentation demonstrates how to use innovative technology in integrating digital humanities (DH) into the history classroom. When teaching the course “China and the World” in the summer of 2023, I assigned students to take distant readings of China-related documents in The Foreign Relations of the United States series with the aid of ChatGPT. The introduction of Word2vec and other popular Natural Language Processing (NPL) algorithms generated by ChatGPT enables students without solid coding skills to analyze the documents quantitatively. The advancement of Generative AI facilitates the integration of DH into traditional history classrooms.
