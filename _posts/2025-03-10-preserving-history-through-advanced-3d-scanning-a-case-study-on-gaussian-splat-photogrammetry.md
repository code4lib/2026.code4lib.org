title: "Preserving History Through Advanced 3D Scanning: A Case Study on Gaussian Splat Photogrammetry"
---
In the realm of historical preservation, innovative technologies play a crucial role in capturing and safeguarding the essence of culturally significant objects and structures. This presentation highlights a cutting-edge 3D scanning project undertaken by our library team, wherein we took over 3,600 photos of multiple rooms of a historically significant building using a novel photogrammetry technique. At the core of our method lies the Gaussian Splat approach, which facilitates real-time radiance field rendering, resulting in highly detailed and realistic 3D models. Our project not only emphasizes the practical applications of this advanced technology in historical documentation but also showcases the challenges and successes encountered during the process. Through this initiative, we aim to inspire further exploration of photogrammetry in cultural heritage conservation and encourage interdisciplinary collaborations between libraries, coding experts, and preservationists.
