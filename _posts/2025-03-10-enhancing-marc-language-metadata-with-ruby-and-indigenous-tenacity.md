title: "Enhancing MARC Language Metadata with Ruby and Indigenous Tenacity"
---
There are many Indigenous and minority languages that are grouped in broader MARC language codes, limiting the ability to find materials in a specific language. I was inspired by the University of Hawaii’s Indigenous Pacific Languages cataloging project, which highlighted the limitations of the MARC Language Codes. I undertook this project to improve language-related discoverability by parsing free text language metadata from MARC field 546 to create new 041 fields with matching ISO 639-3 language codes. The goal was improving the discoverability of Indigenous and minority language materials by enhancing language metadata accuracy. ISO 639-3 language codes can supplement MARC Language Codes for more accurate language representation. In the process, I identified many candidate materials in the library’s collection. This talk will discuss the importance of supplementing with ISO 639-3 language codes, as well as the challenges I encountered as I developed software tools to make that easier for catalogers.
