title: "Getting Everyone on the Same Page: Building a Shared Governance Structure for Digital Projects "
---
Coordinating the work of multiple people on projects can be a thorny problem. This can be especially difficult when folks work in different departments and on different levels of the org chart. The University of Rochester has been working on a governance structure to ensure that the handling of digital projects can be done consistently, that the management of these projects does not depend on a particular person being in a role, and to foster clear communication and greater trust. This presentation will include a discussion of how this iterative process came about, how the framework developed for digital projects management came to be, what artifacts were necessary to create along the way, and how we are going to guarantee that this model will keep us on track and help accomplish our goals well into the future.
