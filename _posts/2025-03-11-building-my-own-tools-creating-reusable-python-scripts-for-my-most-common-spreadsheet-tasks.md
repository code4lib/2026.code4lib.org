title: "Building my own tools: Creating reusable Python scripts for my most common spreadsheet tasks"
---
This presentation will discuss how I, as a beginner/intermediate coder, created a set of easily reusable Python scripts in a GitHub repository to handle my most frequent spreadsheet tasks like merging, matching, evaluating, and cleaning-up data. It will cover common problems that have I encountered, from "what does this script do again" to "why did my barcodes turn into scientific numbers" as well as what I've learned about how to best organize, name, and update reusable Python scripts for longevity, findability, and minimal frustration. Finally, I will share five of my favorite reusable scripts and why I have found them to be so helpful.
