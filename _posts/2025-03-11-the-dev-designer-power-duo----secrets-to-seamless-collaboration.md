title: "The Dev & Designer Power Duo -- Secrets to Seamless Collaboration"
---
Unlock the magic that happens when designers and developers work in harmony. In this talk, we’ll dive into how collaboration across the entire project lifecycle—from that first spark of teamwork—sets the stage for projects that truly shine.

We’ll break down the essentials of a great collaboration: writing tickets that actually make sense, crafting prototypes that speak to both creative and technical minds, and keeping communication open and fun. Plus, we’ll share some awesome collaborative tools to keep everyone on the same page (and avoid those "wait, what?" moments).

We’ll also tackle the tricky stuff, like wrangling scope creep and handling last-minute change requests—without losing sight of the big picture: delivering stunning, user-friendly designs.

Tips and tricks to supercharge your team's communication, smooth out your workflow, and create products that wow users and make your whole team proud.
