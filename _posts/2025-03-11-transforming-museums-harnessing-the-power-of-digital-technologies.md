title: "Transforming Museums: Harnessing the Power of Digital Technologies"
---
The rise of digital imagery and new technologies is reshaping traditional art galleries and museums. Many are embracing hybrid models that blend physical and digital experiences, acknowledging the value of in-person artwork while leveraging technology to broaden their reach and enhance visitor engagement.

How are curators and museum staff navigating this digital shift? This talk explores accessible digital tools and innovative methods for re-contextualizing art in today's digital landscape. Technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) offer immersive museum experiences, allowing visitors to interact with art and culture in new, exciting ways. But there are also cost-effective options. Free or low-cost platforms, such as Microsoft Sway, ThingLink, and Fotor Relight, enable museums to create virtual exhibitions, enhance images with AI tools, and build interactive visual media.

Moreover, techniques like Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) allow for detailed surface analysis of museum objects, revealing fine textures and inscriptions that might otherwise go unnoticed. By adopting even a few digital technologies, museums can create a dynamic blend of physical and virtual spaces, setting the stage for the future of art and museum experiences.
