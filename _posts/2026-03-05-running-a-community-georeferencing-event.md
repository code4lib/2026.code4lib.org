title: "Running a Community Georeferencing Event"
---
The website OldInsuranceMaps.net is designed as a "georeferencing commons", a crowdsourcing site where anyone with an internet connection can sign up and georeference historical Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps from the Library of Congress digital collection, using a friendly workflow directly in a browser. Since the initial pilot project in 2022, multiple universities and community groups have carried out "georeference-a-thons", where students and interested citizens alike come together for a few hours and process maps, usually of the city they are in. Some people work, some people look like they are working, and some prefer to browse the site and talk. More importantly, everyone gets to spend time looking at old maps together, and learning about the history of their community. This workshop will be begin with a demo of the platform and examples from last events, and we'll move to a hands-on activity where all attendees will get to work together to georeference maps of Pittsburgh. Attendees will leave with a good understanding of how this open source (and open data) platform works, as well as an idea of what it would take to facilitate a similar event in their hometown.
