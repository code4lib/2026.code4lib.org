title: "Running a Community Georeferencing Event"
---
The website [OldInsuranceMaps.net](https://oldinsurancemaps.net/) is designed as a
“georeferencing commons”, a crowdsourcing site where anyone with an internet connection
can sign up and georeference historical Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps from the Library of
Congress digital collection, using a friendly workflow directly in a web browser. Since
the initial pilot project in 2022, multiple universities and community groups have
carried out “georeference-a-thons”, where students and interested citizens alike come
together for a few hours and process maps, usually of their own city. Some people work,
some people look like they are working, and some prefer to browse the site and talk.
More importantly, everyone gets to spend time looking at old maps together, and
learning about the history of their community. This workshop will be begin with a demo
of the platform and examples from past events, and we’ll move to a hands-on activity
where all attendees will work together to georeference maps of Philadelphia or another
nearby city. Attendees will leave with a good understanding of how this open source
(and open data) platform works, as well as an idea of what it would take to facilitate
a similar event in their hometown. Depending on attendee interest and experience levels,
we can also look at ways to use the resulting georeferenced map layers in other web
applications and research contexts.
