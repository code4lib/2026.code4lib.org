Dr. Nikko Stevens is a critical technology researcher, software engineer, and community
organizer. As an academic, Stevens studies the ways that data infrastructures--data models,
databases, data structures--can reinforce existing social inequality, and, crucially, how we can
use data infrastructures to guide us towards the worlds we wish to build. As a software
engineer, led the architecture of web properties for billion-dollar corporations like Coca-Cola,
Sony, and Instagram, and their work won numerous awards, including at SXSW. As a community
organizer, Stevens's work in the Drupal community earned them the Aaron Winborn Award and
recognitions by Red Hat and The Linux Foundation. They are currently a postdoctoral researcher
at MIT where they are writing *Abolitionist Engineering,* a book about data infrastructure,
software engineering, and the contemporary prison abolition movement.
