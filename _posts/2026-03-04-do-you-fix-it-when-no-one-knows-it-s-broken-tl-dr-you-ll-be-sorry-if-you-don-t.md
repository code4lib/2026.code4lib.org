In trying to programmatically correct some basic metadata, a larger issue was discovered.  The entire sum of our submissions to the Internet Archive (IA), while they presented with a uniform appearance, had too many varying hierarchies in the underlying items, to allow any reliable means of processing.  Our contributions to IA, all of them, needed to be pulled back, uniformly restructured, and resubmitted in a reliably expected arrangement.

Presentation will walk through the project, showing the importance of data standardization over working with, or coding around, known, and potentially unknown, structures of data and materials.
