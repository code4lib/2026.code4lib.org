title: "Hybrid:  Future of Code4Lib Journal"
---
I represent five people who are the current active editors of Code4lib Journal (Edward Corrado, Kirsta Stapelfeldt, Mark Swenson, Mark Eaton, and Péter Király) and we are proposing that there be a conversation about the future of Code4lib Journal based on our email and the subsequent responses we received on the Code4lib mailing list in mid-November 2025. However, none of us can come to the conference. We are seeking a on-site person who could actually facilitate this discussion, which we would propose attending remotely, but wanted to get this idea in before the workshop proposals closed. Very open to a different forum, but it seems like there is appetite for discussing this as part of the conference program.
