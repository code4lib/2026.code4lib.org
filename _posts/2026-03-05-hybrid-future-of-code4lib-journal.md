title: "CANCELLED: Hybrid: Future of Code4Lib Journal"
---
**This session has been cancelled. We apologize for any inconvenience.**

Code4Lib Journal has long occupied a distinctive space within library technology publishing, offering an open, community-driven venue for practitioner scholarship that does not fit comfortably within traditional academic journals. As the journal has grown in visibility and scope, however, its largely informal structures—editorial, technical, and organizational—have come under increasing strain. Recent challenges, including a high-profile incident involving the accidental publication of personally identifiable information, have further highlighted the limitations of the journal’s current model and the need for more deliberate governance and shared responsibility.

This post-conference workshop reflects on Code4Lib Journal’s evolution and situates the journal at a genuine crossroads. Drawing on the experiences of current editors and the community discussion initiated on the Code4Lib mailing list in November 2025, we review the journal’s origins, editorial aims, infrastructure, and recent crises, with an emphasis on lessons learned and future opportunities. The session invites participants to engage directly in the work of editorial planning: brainstorming paper and special issue ideas, drafting policy responses to emerging technologies such as AI, and considering alternative organizational structures for the journal. Our hope is that the workshop will encourage participants to seek to be involved with the journal going forward.

Rather than proposing a single solution, this presentation frames the future of Code4Lib Journal as a collective project. It argues that sustainability, ethical publishing, and editorial resilience depend on broader participation, clearer structures, and an honest accounting of capacity and risk. Attendees will leave with a clearer understanding of how community-run journals function in practice, where they are most vulnerable, and how they can be strengthened through shared stewardship.
