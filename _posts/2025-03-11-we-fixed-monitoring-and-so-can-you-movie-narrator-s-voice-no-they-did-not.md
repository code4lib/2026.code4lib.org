title: "We Fixed Monitoring, and So Can You! (Movie Narrator’s Voice: “No, they did not.”)"
---
Can you fix monitoring? Not really. But, you can make it work for your team, no matter how large or small. In this talk, we’ll share how we evaluated monitoring systems, choose the best match for our team, and incorporated collaboration and scalability. We’ll describe our monitoring journey, from comparing tools to documenting and interpreting what our monitoring system has been telling us. We’ll talk about how we’ve expanded our team culture to use monitoring to prevent potential outages, track post-incident issues when outages do occur, manage alert fatigue, and create opportunities for junior DevOps folks to learn more about our systems as a whole through monitoring. Although our DevOps team is large, we believe -- and have examples of how -- our approach can be scaled at any institution and on any level.
