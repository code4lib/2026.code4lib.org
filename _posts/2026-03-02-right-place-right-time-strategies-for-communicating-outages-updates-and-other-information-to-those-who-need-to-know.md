title: "Right place, right time: strategies for communicating outages, updates and other information to those who need to know"
---
Despite our best efforts for a seamless user experience, the inevitable happens: system outages, error messages, maintenance downtime, platform changes, et cetera. With the huge range of online systems and tools our libraries utilize, there's so many different ways to communicate important news to patrons and colleagues. It's easy to get a message out there - but how can we target the users who are most affected and put that messaging where they're most likely to see it? 

This presentation will cover the resources and methods our library systems team uses for external communication (website, Primo, status page, A-Z list, Libkey Nomad ++, and more) as well as internal (Teams, staff listserv, email). It will also cover strategies for deciding which methods to use for different types of issues or levels of urgency.
