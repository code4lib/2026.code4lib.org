title: How To Host Code4Lib
---
Have you ever thought about hosting Code4Lib, but don't know where to start? This workshop will introduce you to the Code4Lib planning process, from putting together a proposal to host, to budgeting and sponsorship, to how the program is built, to the day-to-day logistics that make the conference work. We'll cover the conference's needs for space, food, A/V, and more. Since Code4Lib is a volunteer community, there are dozens of volunteers each year who help with various parts of this work. You'll learn how those committees work, and how it all comes together each year.
