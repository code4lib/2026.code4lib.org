title: "Spreadsheet to Service: Building a Zero-Cost Search Interface (The LACLI Story)"
---
The LACLI project began as an emergency measure to share free, online resources for Latin American, Caribbean, Latinx, and Iberian studies during the pandemic lockdown. It has since grown into a multinational effort of 50 volunteers who have indexed over 1,300 diverse resources.

Spreadsheets: where much good research goes to die, but we hope the LACLI story will inspire others to build a search interface that encourages broader public interaction with meticulously curated research corpora. My talk will chart how LACLI uses Google Apps Script to transform a Google Sheet into an API endpoint. This approach allows collaborators to quickly contribute as no specialized database training is required: they simply edit the Google Sheet. I will cover how we use vanilla JavaScript to create a client-side keyword and faceted search interface. Finally, I will discuss user feedback and LACLI’s relationship with the Latin American Northeast Libraries Network (LANE).
