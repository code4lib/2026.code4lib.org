attendee-requirements: Attendees will need a laptop with a Windows or Mac operating system (plus charging cable). They will need to install Quire (https://quire.getty.edu/docs-v1/install-uninstall/) and Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) in advance. A general knowledge of YAML and Markdown is a plus, but the workshop is designed for absolute beginners.

title: Hands-On Digital Publishing Workshop with Quire
---
This workshop serves as an introduction to Quire, an open-source publishing tool developed by Getty and available for anyone to use for free. Quire is not a publishing service or a platform for hosting publications. Instead, it provides users (students, researchers, professors, curators, editors, and more) with the ability to produce multimedia-rich publications for the web. The same files used to create the website can also be used to create a PDF, e-book, and print book, making it the perfect solution for creating long-lasting and discoverable publications.

The workshop seeks to break down the tools, formats, and processes necessary for using Quire into approachable, easy-to-understand concepts complemented by hands-on exercises. The workshop kicks off by introducing attendees to the basic concepts of how Quire functions, including learning to operate the command line, using a text editor to store content and images, and writing in Markdown and YAML. These concepts are then implemented as participants get a new project up and running, edit content, and make customizations on their own.

Quire does not have a graphic user interface and is less intuitive than other digital publishing options. Our goal is to help people gain confidence in navigating and using a tool that represents a different way of working than they might be used to. We aim for individuals who take this workshop to leave feeling excited to continue experimenting and creating, and we will provide resources for that continued exploration.
