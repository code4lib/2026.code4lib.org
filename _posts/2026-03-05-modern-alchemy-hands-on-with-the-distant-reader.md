title: "Modern Alchemy: Hands-On with the Distant Reader"
---
In this hands-on workshop participants will first learn how to use a Web-based system called the Distant Reader to transform sets of unstructured data (like bunches o' journal articles) into structured data, affectionally called "study carrels". These data sets are amenable to analysis by both people as well as computers. Second, participants will learn how to use both command-line tools as well as GUI applications (like AntConc, OpenRefine, or Gephi) to analyze the data sets.  This analysis includes things such as feature extraction, concordancing, topic modeling, full text indexing, semantic indexing, network analysis, etc. In the end, participants will learn of an additional ways to turn data into information -- modern alchemy.
