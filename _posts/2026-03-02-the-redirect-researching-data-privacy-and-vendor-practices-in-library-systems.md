title: "The Redirect: Researching Data Privacy and Vendor Practices in Library Systems"
---
As concerns about data privacy continue to grow and become increasingly difficult to navigate, how can we help library patrons make informed decisions about data privacy? An ongoing project within the Cornell University Library is researching data privacy policies and the information collected by library vendor websites. Learn about how I investigated a tool called Blacklight Query to understand what type of information is collected by library vendors when patrons are redirected from the Cornell University Library catalog. I will also discuss our work to add this information to our catalog to help patrons make more informed decisions when accessing the library’s electronic resources.
