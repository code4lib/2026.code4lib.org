title: "Introduction to Omeka S Theming"
---
[Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/) is an open-source web publishing platform for digital collections, that allows users to publish their items through flexible sites. Users present these web exhibitions using themes, packages that control the visual style and customization of a given Omeka S site.

This workshop will introduce designers and developers to the process of creating a theme. Participants should be familiar with theming concepts for other platforms and be comfortable with HTML, CSS, and PHP. Experience with Omeka is encouraged but not required. The workshop will cover basics including theme requirements planning, a survey of common components of an Omeka S site, where to find default markup and overwrite it with custom markup, and how to provide theme settings.

There will also be coverage of more advanced topics, touching on page and block templates creation, providing configurable content blocks on resource pages, and working with component libraries made available by the Omeka S core. Concepts will come together in walkthroughs of existing Omeka S projects, where participants can see what project pages look like from the Omeka S admin as well as from the theme file directory. The session will conclude with a discussion component, opening up the floor to what kinds of features or community support would be helpful to Omeka S theme developers.
