title: "Introduction to Omeka S Theming"
---
Omeka S (https://omeka.org/s/) is a open-source web publishing platform for digital collections, that allows users to publish their items through flexible sites. Users present these web exhibitions using themes, packages that control the visual style and customizations of a given Omeka S site. 

This workshop will introduce designers and developers to the process of creating a theme, offering a survey of common components of an Omeka S site, where to find default markup, how to overwrite it with custom markup, and how to provide theme settings. Participants will have the opportunity to work hands-on with the process of adapting an existing theme, implementing page templates, and creating theme settings.

Depending on audience expertise and interest, the workshop will also include more advanced topics, touching on creating page and block templates, providing configurable content blocks on resource pages, and working with component libraries made available by the Omeka S core. 

The workshop will feature a discussion component, opening up the floor to what kinds of features or community support would be helpful to Omeka S theme developers.
